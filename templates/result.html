        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>The supply chain optimization model used linear programming to minimize total costs, which include production, storage, and transportation costs. The total cost of the solution is ${{ result['total_cost'] }}. The solution ensures that {{ result['demand_fulfilled_percentage'] }}% of the demand is fulfilled for all customers. The production cost amounts to ${{ result['total_production_cost'] }}, while the storage cost is ${{ result['total_storage_cost'] }}. The transportation cost, which includes movement of products between factories, warehouses, and customers, is ${{ result['total_transport_cost'] }}.</p>
        <p>The model generated an optimal plan for the number of units to be produced at each factory and transported to customers and warehouses. The final inventory levels at each factory and warehouse are presented in the table above. This inventory reflects the remaining units after fulfilling the demand and executing the transport plan.</p>
